Code for lab 6 of NMD 105.
This lab tasts the use of loops and arrays. 
The first task is to declare an array of colors and then to draw an x out of shapes with random colors from the array.
The second task is to draw a grid of 5x5 squares with a color gradient. The task is also done by using nested loops.
The final task was to add mouse interactivity to the first two projects. This task proved to be a bit more difficult as noLoop() and 
getting mouse input seemed to clash quite a bit in p5js. 
I ended up having to save the random colors to an array in setup and then call them in update, mouseY affects the size of the circles and holding down
the mouse changes to task2.
